// Distributing 802.11k neighbour lists across the fleet.
//
// internal/roaming has the reasoning for why this exists and why the controller
// relays hostapd's own element rather than building one. This file is the part
// that talks to devices, and its own decisions are below.
//
// # Why it reconciles instead of applying
//
// Every other write in this system goes through the apply engine: stage, apply
// with a rollback armed, check health, confirm. That machinery exists because a
// bad UCI change can sever the network and a device must be able to undo it
// alone.
//
// None of that applies here. `rrm_nr_set` writes runtime state in hostapd, not
// config; it cannot be rolled back because there is nothing to roll back to
// except the empty list the AP already had; and the worst outcome of getting it
// wrong is that a client scans more channels than it needed to. Routing this
// through the apply engine would arm a rollback timer, hold the global apply
// lock that serialises the whole fleet, and demand a health check for a change
// that cannot make a device unhealthy. So it reconciles: read, compare, write
// what differs, and report.
//
// # Why the current list is read back rather than remembered
//
// The tempting optimisation is to record what was last pushed and skip the
// read. It does not survive contact with the device. Measured on the reference
// hardware: `wifi reload` after editing one section restarted that BSS and
// cleared its neighbour list, while the *other* BSS on the same device — whose
// config had not changed — kept its list intact. So neither "an apply clears
// everything" nor "an apply clears nothing" is true, and a controller that
// assumed either would leave APs silently empty.
//
// Reading `rrm_nr_list` back makes the operation idempotent against any cause
// of loss, including ones nobody has thought of: a hostapd crash, an operator's
// own `wifi reload`, a device rebooting between cycles. It costs one call per
// BSS, in the same batched request as the read that has to happen anyway.

// neighbourInterval is the backstop cadence.
//
// Neighbour data changes when a BSS appears, disappears or moves channel. None
// of those is fast, so this is deliberately slow — it shares the 15-minute
// rhythm the collector already uses for the board identity and the radio list,
// for the same reason: these are facts that change on the timescale of someone
// walking to a cupboard, not of a poll.
//
// The cost at this cadence is what makes the feature free. Per device per
// cycle: one `iwinfo.devices` call, one batched request carrying two calls per
// wireless interface, and — only when something actually differs — one more
// batched request to push. Against DEVICE-BUDGET's ceiling of one request per
// minute that is under a tenth of the allowance, and in the steady state where
// nothing has moved the third request never happens at all.
const neighbourInterval = 15 * time.Minute

// neighbourDeviceTimeout bounds one device's share of a cycle. A device that
// has gone away must not stop the rest of the fleet from being reconciled —
// which is the same rule Preview follows, for the same reason.
